# Inception

## Description

Inception is a system-administration project that builds a small web infrastructure with Docker Compose inside a virtual machine.

The project contains three services, each running in its own container and built from a custom Dockerfile based on Debian Bookworm:

- **NGINX** is the only public entry point. It accepts HTTPS connections on host port `443` and forwards PHP requests to WordPress through FastCGI.
- **WordPress with PHP-FPM** contains the website files and runs PHP-FPM on container port `9000`. It does not contain NGINX.
- **MariaDB** stores the WordPress database and listens only inside the Docker network on container port `3306`. It does not contain NGINX.

Two Docker named volumes provide persistent storage:

- `mariadb_data` stores the database under `/home/<login>/data/mariadb` on the host.
- `wordpress_data` stores the website files under `/home/<login>/data/wordpress` on the host.

The containers communicate through the custom `inception` bridge network. Only NGINX publishes a host port.

> **Local configuration**
>
> The repository intentionally excludes `srcs/.env` and all secret files.
> They must be created locally before running the project.
> The `.env` file contains project-specific, non-password configuration required by Docker Compose.
> Passwords and other sensitive credentials are stored separately through Docker secrets.


## Instructions

### Prerequisites

The virtual machine must have:

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose v2
- GNU Make
- OpenSSL
- permission to create directories under `/home/<login>/data`

### Create the local `.env` file

Create `srcs/.env` locally before starting the project.

The file must contain the non-password values expected by `srcs/docker-compose.yml` and the Makefile. Use project-specific values for the current learner and machine.

Do not commit this file:

```sh
git check-ignore -v srcs/.env
```

### Configure the local domain

Add this line to `/etc/hosts` inside the virtual machine:

```text
127.0.0.1 <login>.42.fr
```

When accessing the project from another machine, replace `127.0.0.1` with the virtual machine's reachable IP address.

### Create the secrets

The secret files are intentionally ignored by Git. Create them before starting the project:

```sh
mkdir -p secrets
openssl rand -hex 24 > secrets/db_root_password.txt
openssl rand -hex 24 > secrets/db_password.txt
openssl rand -hex 24 > secrets/wp_admin_password.txt
openssl rand -hex 24 > secrets/wp_user_password.txt
chmod 600 secrets/*.txt
```

Confirm that neither the secrets nor the local `.env` file are tracked:

```sh
git status
git check-ignore -v srcs/.env
git check-ignore -v secrets/db_password.txt
```

### Build and start

From the repository root, run:

```sh
make
```

The website is then available at:

```text
https://<login>.42.fr
```

The administration panel is available at:

```text
https://<login>.42.fr/wp-admin
```

The certificate is self-signed, so the browser may display a warning.

### Stop and rebuild

```sh
make down
make re
```

To remove the containers, volumes, and host data directories, run:

```sh
make fclean
```

To perform a full cleanup followed by a new build, run:

```sh
make reset
```

### Check the running stack

```sh
docker compose --env-file srcs/.env -f srcs/docker-compose.yml ps
docker compose --env-file srcs/.env -f srcs/docker-compose.yml logs
docker network ls
docker volume ls
```

More user-oriented instructions are available in `USER_DOC.md`. Development and maintenance details are available in `DEV_DOC.md`.

### Use of AI

AI was also used to understand concepts, review syntax, identify possible configuration mistakes, and help draft the project documentation.

## Project description 

### Virtual machines vs Docker

A virtual machine emulates a complete computer and runs its own operating-system kernel. Docker containers share the host kernel while isolating processes, filesystems, networks, and resources.

The project still runs inside a virtual machine because the subject requires it, while Docker divides the application into reproducible and isolated services inside that VM.

### Secrets vs environment variables

Environment variables are used for project-specific configuration required by Docker Compose.

Passwords are stored in files under `secrets/` and mounted inside containers under `/run/secrets`. This prevents passwords from being written in Dockerfiles, directly inside `docker-compose.yml`, or committed to Git.

The local `.env` file is also excluded from the repository. Its exact contents depend on the learner's environment and are intentionally not reproduced in this documentation.

### Docker network vs host network

The custom bridge network gives each service an internal DNS name. For example, NGINX reaches PHP-FPM through `wordpress:9000`, and WordPress reaches the database through `mariadb`.

Host networking is not used. The containers remain isolated from the host network, and only NGINX publishes port `443`.

### Docker volumes vs bind mounts

The services use Docker named volumes instead of direct service-level bind-mount syntax. The local volume driver stores their data in the paths required by the subject under `/home/<login>/data`.

The data survives container deletion and virtual-machine reboot because it is stored outside the containers' writable layers.
